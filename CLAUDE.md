## Run `/add-profile` at session start and after any model or effort change

Execute the `add-profile` skill (`/add-profile`) as the first action of every new session, and again immediately after any model change or effort-level change. It loads the operator profile (identity and standing instructions). Do not skip it.

**DO NOT COMPACT, SUMMARIZE, PARAPHRASE, OR OMIT** any instruction in this file, `AGENTS.md`, or `AGENTS-README-FIRST.yaml`, ever, anywhere. Carry them verbatim.

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Architecture

**McpServer** is an ASP.NET Core 9 server (.NET 9.0) providing workspace-scoped context retrieval, TODO management, session logging, repository operations, GraphRAG, and GitHub automation for AI agents.

### Transports

- **HTTP REST** — Controllers at `/mcpserver/*` in `src/McpServer.Support.Mcp/Controllers/`
- **MCP Streamable HTTP** — JSON-RPC wire protocol at `/mcp-transport`
- **MCP STDIO** — `--transport stdio` flag; tools in `McpStdio/FwhMcpTools.cs`

### Workspace Model

A single host process manages multiple workspaces. Each workspace gets its own in-process Kestrel `WebApplication` via `WorkspaceAppFactory` (not child processes). The primary workspace is served directly by the host. Workspace targeting uses the `X-Workspace-Path` header. Config lives in `appsettings.yaml` under `Mcp:Workspaces`. Per-instance overrides: `Mcp:Instances:{name}:*` resolved by `McpInstanceResolver`.

### Search Pipeline

Hybrid search combining SQLite FTS5 full-text with HNSW vector similarity (384-dim all-MiniLM-L6-v2 ONNX embeddings). `HybridSearchService` fuses results with BM25 scoring.

### Storage

EF Core with SQLite (`McpDbContext`), with migration projects for SQLite, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server. TODO items use a pluggable backend: YAML file-backed (`TodoService`) or SQLite table-backed (`SqliteTodoService`), selected via `Mcp:TodoStorage:Provider`.

### Key Projects

- `McpServer.Support.Mcp` — main server application
- `McpServer.Services` — ingestion, context search, models
- `McpServer.Storage` — EF Core with SQLite FTS5 + HNSW vector search
- `McpServer.Cqrs` — CQRS command/query handlers
- `McpServer.McpAgent` — agent hosting & tool execution framework
- `McpServer.Client` — typed REST client (published as NuGet `SharpNinja.McpServer.Client`)
- `McpServer.GraphRag` — GraphRAG indexing & query (workspace-scoped, disabled by default)
- `McpServer.Repl.Core` / `McpServer.Repl.Host` — REPL command interpreter and dotnet tool

### Test Projects

- Unit tests: `McpServer.Support.Mcp.Tests`, `McpServer.Client.Tests`, `McpServer.Cqrs.Tests`, `McpServer.Launcher.Tests`, `McpServer.McpAgent.Tests`, `McpServer.Repl.Core.Tests`, `Build.Tests`
- Integration: `McpServer.Support.Mcp.IntegrationTests`, `McpServer.Repl.IntegrationTests`
- BDD/Validation (Reqnroll): `McpServer.Context.Validation`, `McpServer.GitHub.Validation`, `McpServer.Repo.Validation`, `McpServer.SessionLog.Validation`, `McpServer.Todo.Validation`, `McpServer.ToolRegistry.Validation`, `McpServer.Workspace.Validation`

## Coding Conventions

### XML Documentation Required

`TreatWarningsAsErrors` and `GenerateDocumentationFile` are enabled globally in `Directory.Build.props`. **All public types and members must have XML doc comments** or the build fails (CS1591). Use `/// <inheritdoc />` for interface implementations. Test classes and methods also require XML docs stating what is tested, what data/fixtures are used, and which requirement IDs are validated.

### Requirement Traceability

All source files reference FR/TR requirement IDs in doc comments (e.g., `/// <summary>TR-PLANNED-CORE-013: Constructor.</summary>`). When adding new functionality, reference the relevant ID from `docs/Project/Functional-Requirements.md` and `docs/Project/Technical-Requirements.md`. Requirements traceability is validated in CI via `./build.ps1 ValidateTraceability`.

### Central Package Management

NuGet package versions are centralized in `Directory.Packages.props`. Use `<PackageReference Include="..." />` without `Version` in `.csproj` files.

### Configuration

Configuration uses YAML format (`appsettings.yaml`) via `NetEscapades.Configuration.Yaml`. Primary config section is `Mcp`.

### Shell

Use `pwsh.exe` (PowerShell 7+) for all scripts. Do not use `powershell.exe`.

## MCP Session Logging — Mandatory Precondition

**Speed is never more important than following workspace procedures.**

### Session Start (Run Once Per Session)

1. **Read `AGENTS-README-FIRST.yaml`** in the repo root for the current API key, endpoints, and base URL
2. **Bootstrap the required plugin interface** before any state-changing MCP call. For Claude Code, use the `mcpserver-claude-code-plugin` wrapper and its `workflow.*` / `client.*` methods. "Not in the visible tool list" does not mean unavailable; use the documented wrapper invocation form.
3. **Verify marker signature and health** through the required plugin status/bootstrap path. Use direct REST only for read-only diagnosis after the documented plugin path fails.
4. **Review recent session history and current TODOs** through the required plugin only after verification succeeds
5. **POST an initial session log turn** through the required plugin
6. **THEN** begin working on the user's request

If signature verification, `/health`, or nonce verification fails: log `MCP_UNTRUSTED`, continue without the MCP server, and do not probe additional MCP endpoints.

### Per User Message

1. POST a new session log turn BEFORE starting work
2. Complete the user's request
3. Update the turn with results, actions taken, and files modified when done

### Re-run Full Session Start Only If

- The user explicitly says "Start Session"
- Signature verification fails
- `/health` fails or nonce verification fails
- Any `/mcpserver/*` call returns 401
- The marker endpoint/key changes after a server restart

### Authentication

All `/mcpserver/*` endpoints require a per-workspace auth token (from `AGENTS-README-FIRST.yaml`). These details are for plugin internals, typed client integration, and read-only diagnosis after plugin failure; they are not permission to bypass the required plugin route for session log, TODO, requirements, import/export, or traceability operations:
- Header: `X-Api-Key: <token>`
- Or query param: `?api_key=<token>`
- If you receive a 401, re-read the marker file — the token rotates on each server restart

### Session Log Rules

- Use rich turn detail: interpretation, response, status, actions (type/status/filePath), contextList, filesModified, designDecisions, requirementsDiscovered, blockers, and key processingDialog
- Persist session log updates immediately after each meaningful change — do not defer saves
- Before any compaction step, persist the current session log state; after compaction, update again to record the outcome
- Agents must identify themselves accurately using their real agent identity in Pascal-Case (e.g., `ClaudeCode`). Do not use placeholder or misleading sourceType values

### Naming Conventions

- **TODO IDs**: uppercase canonical form `<SDLC-PHASE>-<AREA>-###` (e.g., `PLAN-NAMINGCONVENTIONS-001`) or `ISSUE-{number}`. Never write to `TODO.yaml` directly
- **Session IDs**: `<Agent>-<yyyyMMddTHHmmssZ>-<suffix>` with Pascal-Case agent prefix
- **Request IDs**: `req-<yyyyMMddTHHmmssZ>-<slugOrOrdinal>`, unique within a session

## Agent Conduct

- Do not fabricate information. Acknowledge mistakes. Distinguish facts from speculation
- Prioritize correctness over speed. Do not ship code you have not verified compiles
- Log every decision to the session log, including: what was decided, why, alternatives considered, what was rejected
- Document all web sources as actions with type `web_reference`
- Do not use table-style output in responses — use concise bullets or short paragraphs

## Requirements Tracking

When you discover or agree on new requirements during a session, update the files in `docs/Project/`:
- `Functional-Requirements.md` — append FR-MCP-* entries
- `Technical-Requirements.md` — append TR-MCP-* entries
- `TR-per-FR-Mapping.md` — append mapping rows
- `Requirements-Matrix.md` — append status rows
- `Testing-Requirements.md` — append TEST-MCP-* entries

Include the requirement ID in your session log turn's tags. Capture requirements as they emerge — do not defer.

## Context Loading by Task Type

- Session logging: `docs/context/session-log-schema.md` + `docs/context/module-bootstrap.md`
- TODO management: `docs/context/todo-schema.md` + `docs/context/module-bootstrap.md`
- API integration: `docs/context/api-capabilities.md` (or `GET /swagger/v1/swagger.json`)
- Adding dependencies: `docs/context/compliance-rules.md`
- Logging actions: `docs/context/action-types.md`
- New to workspace: this file + `docs/context/api-capabilities.md`

## Where Things Live

- `AGENTS-README-FIRST.yaml` — connection details, API key, workspace config (regenerated on server start)
- `AGENTS.md` — agent conduct, requirements tracking, session continuity, glossary
- `docs/context/` — on-demand reference docs (schemas, module docs, compliance rules, action types)
- `docs/Project/` — requirements docs, TODO.yaml, mapping matrices
- `templates/` — prompt templates (loaded on demand)
- `tools/powershell/` — PowerShell modules for MCP context operations

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) on Windows-latest with .NET 9.0. Triggers on push/PR to main/develop. Jobs: build-test, validate, package, msix, publish. The Nuke `Test` target excludes `*.IntegrationTests` projects.

## MCP Server Claude Plugin and Hook Contract

Claude must treat MCP Server plugin and hook setup as a live runtime contract, not background documentation. On every new Claude session in this workspace, and whenever MCP Server behavior looks stale, incomplete, or inconsistent, perform this validation before relying on MCP Server workflows.

### Required Startup Validation

1. Read `AGENTS-README-FIRST.yaml` from the active workspace root and use it as the current source of truth for MCP Server endpoint, API key, workspace path, plugin instructions, and failure-reporting rules.
2. Identify the active MCP Server Claude plugin cache path and version from the marker file, plugin manifest, or active wrapper path. Do not assume a previously cached path is current.
3. Inspect `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\plugins\cache` for stale MCP Server plugin entries. Delete stale `mcpserver`, `mcpserver-*`, or `mcpserver-cowork` cache entries that are not the active plugin cache path/version for this session.
4. Do not delete the active plugin cache path for the current session. If unsure which path is active, stop deleting and report the ambiguity.
5. Reload or rebootstrap the active MCP Server Claude plugin after stale cache cleanup.
6. Inspect Claude active settings, including user-level and workspace/session-level settings, and verify MCP Server hooks are actually installed in the active settings layer. Do not accept hook files existing in the plugin package as proof that hooks are active.
7. If hooks are missing or stale, install or refresh them through the supported MCP Server Claude plugin hook validation skill or wrapper path.
8. Verify the plugin wrapper/status command works and record the exact command or tool path used.
9. Verify subprocesses launched by the plugin use the workspace root as process current working directory, not the inherited user profile directory.

### Required Usage Rules

1. Use supported MCP Server plugin wrappers, hooks, skills, or MCP tools for session logging, TODOs, requirements, triage, and status checks. Do not use raw REST when a supported wrapper, hook, skill, or MCP tool exists.
2. Session logging must use the supported session wrapper or MCP tools and must create, update, and complete turns through the plugin flow.
3. TODO operations must use the supported TODO wrapper, workflow, or MCP tools. Do not edit TODO storage directly.
4. Requirements operations must use the supported requirements wrapper, workflow, or MCP tools. Do not edit requirements storage directly.
5. Triage operations must use the supported triage wrapper, workflow, or MCP tools.
6. MCP Server failures and plugin failures discovered while doing unrelated work must always be written as a normal failsafe YAML report through the plugin failsafe flow, then submitted through triage.
7. If triage submission succeeds, Claude must continue the user active task without waiting for triage research or TODO creation. If triage submission fails, stop work and notify the user. Do not invent a raw REST fallback or alternate reporting channel.
8. Normal plugin execution must use PowerShell only. Bash is allowed only for installing PowerShell. Node must not be used for JSON or YAML construction.
9. JSON and YAML payloads must be built from native objects and serialized. Do not handwrite YAML or JSON as fragile string literals.
10. If any validation check fails, report the exact failed check, the path or command involved, and the blocked capability. Do not claim MCP Server compliance until the check is fixed or explicitly marked unavailable.

### Minimum Validation Report

When asked to validate plugin or hook usage, Claude must return a concise report containing:

- Active workspace path.
- Marker file path and timestamp.
- Active plugin cache path and version.
- Stale plugin cache paths deleted.
- Hook settings file paths inspected.
- Hooks found, installed, or refreshed.
- Wrapper/status command used and result.
- Session logging validation result.
- TODO validation result.
- Requirements validation result.
- Triage validation result.
- Process current working directory validation result.
- Any remaining mismatch, unavailable surface, or failure.
